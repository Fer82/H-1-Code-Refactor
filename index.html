    <p style="color:red;">Etymology: The word universe derives from the
    Old French word univers, which in turn derives from the Latin word
    universum.[33] The Latin word was used by Cicero and later Latin
    authors in many of the same senses as the modern English word is
    used.</p>

    <p style="color:rgb(89, 0, 255);">The universe (Latin: universus) is
    all of space and time[a] and their contents,[10] including planets,
    stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. While the
    spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to
    measure the size of the observable universe, which is currently
    estimated to be 93 billion light-years in diameter. In various
    multiverse hypotheses, a universe is one of many causally
    disconnected[11] constituent parts of a larger multiverse, which
    itself comprises all of space and time and its contents;[12] as a
    consequence, ‘the universe’ and ‘the multiverse’ are synonymous in
    such theories.</p>

    <p style="color:darkblue;">The earliest cosmological models of the
    universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and
    were geocentric, placing Earth at the center.[13][14] Over the
    centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus
    Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the
    center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal
    gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus' work as well as
    Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho
    Brahe.</p>
